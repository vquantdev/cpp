--------------------------------
Welcome to the Pointers Program!
--------------------------------

1. Original variable

std::string name = "James Bond"
int age = 35;


--------------------------------

2. Creating a pointer to the address of a variable

std::string *pname = &name;

int *page = &age;


--------------------------------

Pointer to (the address of) a variable 'name' = 0x16ce4eed0

Pointer to (the address of) a variable 'age' = 0x16ce4eecc


--------------------------------

3. Accessing the value stored at the address

Use dereference operator *pointer

The value of a variable 'name' (stored at the address 0x16ce4eed0) = James Bond

The value of a variable 'age' (stored at the address 0x16ce4eecc) = 35


--------------------------------

4. Working with arrays

std::string freePizzas[5] = {"pizza 1", "pizza 2", "pizza 3", "pizza 4", "pizza 5"};

freePizzas is the address (0x16ce4ef30) of where the array is stored

Create a pointer to an array: std::string *pfreePizzas = freePizzas;

Pointer to (the address of) an array 'freePizzas' = 0x16ce4ef30

The FIRST value of an array (stored at the address 0x16ce4ef30) = pizza 1

Increment pointer = go to the next address: pFreePizzas++;

The next value (2) the pointer pointing to (address 0x16ce4ef48) is: pizza 2

The next value (3) the pointer pointing to (address 0x16ce4ef60) is: pizza 3

The next value (4) the pointer pointing to (address 0x16ce4ef78) is: pizza 4

The next value (5) the pointer pointing to (address 0x16ce4ef90) is: pizza 5

Try to access the next value at the address 0x16ce4efa8:
